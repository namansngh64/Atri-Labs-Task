I am working on windows so I had to use env and shell(or only shell works) to use the git bash installed in my computer to run commands like ls (dir in windows) etc. SO if you are using linux you dont have to use the env and shell params in exec!

It took me 3-4 whole days to read through documentations, finding every possible thing as this was my first time making a shell script type using node.js

Particularly 'fg' and 'bg' were not working for me (job control error) which I tried to solve but all in vain

I tried this in a linux environment and 'fg' and 'bg' were working atleast!(don't know if working correctly or not but they were working)

PS:- This was my first time to make a bash scripting type project and I did my best on what I could find on internet.
